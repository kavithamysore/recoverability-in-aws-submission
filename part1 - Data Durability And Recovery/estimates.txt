Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage
	In an Amazon RDS Multi-AZ deployment, Amazon RDS automatically creates a primary database (DB) instance and synchronously replicates the data to an instance in a different AZ. When it detects a failure, Amazon RDS automatically fails over to a standby instance without manual intervention. For Multi-AZ with one standby, A new primary is available to serve your new workload in as quickly as 60 seconds. Hence minimum RTO is 60 seconds. 

Minimum RTO for a single region outage
	Assuming the primary database in the primary region goes down, the minimum RTO is as below
	00:00 - Problem happens (0 minutes)
	00:05 - An amount of time passes before an alert triggers (5 minutes)
	00:06 - Alert triggers on-all staff indicating primary database is down(1 minute)
	00:16 - On-call staff may need to get out of bed, get to computer, log in, log onto VPN (10 minutes)
	00:26 - On-call staff starts diagnosing issue and decides to failover to secondary read replica database(10 minutes)
	00:31 - Stop all applications connecting to primary database(5 minutes)
	00:46 - Read replica database instance in another region is promoted (15 minutes)
	01:01 - Remidiation begins to make load balancer changes to divert primary database traffic to secondary database (15 minutes)
	01:11 - Remediation completed (10 minutes)
	01:16 - Start back the applications earlier stopped
	Total time: 1 hour 16 minutes

	An RTO of one hour 20 minutes for this incident would be reasonable.


Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage
	For Multi-AZ with one standby, minimum RPO would be 60 seconds

Minimum RPO for a single region outage
	Considering the RTO for single region outage, the applications connecting to the primary database are brought down at 31st minute of the incident. If transaction log backups are initiated every 4 hours, the Minimum RPO for a single region outage would be 4 hour and 31 minutes.
